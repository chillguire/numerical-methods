# Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations calculator

Simple web application made in HTML, CSS and JS for my calculus class. It features three of the main methods for the approximation of differential equations such as Runge–Kutta and predictor–corrector by providing the function to be approximated, the step and objective as well as the initial condition.
